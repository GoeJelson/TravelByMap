# TravelByMap
This is my Travel By Map assignment for Klump's VGP class at Lewis University

To play this game you must execute the desktop launcher file that can be found in the desktop package. 

The game is simple. You are shown a map of my apartment and using (W,A,S,D,Q,E,+,-) you are able to 

Move Up - W
Move Left - A
Move Down - S
Move Right - D
Rotate Left - Q
Rotate Right E
Zoom In - +
Zoom Out - -

After zooming in five times the map will update to show you a similar map but with seperate drawings
Zooming out from that point will immediatly re render and show you the unmarked map
